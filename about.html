        About
      </h2>
      <p>Rewilding aims to regenerate, reconnect and restore to create healthy, fully
        functioning ecosystems. This is achieved through 'cores, corridors and carnivores' -
        protecting core wilderness areas, reconnecting habitats to allow wildlife to move freely,
        and
        restoring lost keystone species.
        But as a critical part of our dominant ecosystem, humans must become part of rewilding. The
        rewilding of the self is a renewed fascination with the natural world, a reawakening of our
        senses and intuition, and a dissolution of the false boundaries between our atomized selves
        and our home on earth. It is the restoration of a meaningful connection with nature,
        ourselves, and each other. Ultimately, it is the regeneration of our sacred relationship
        with
        the natural world; our spiritual selves must also be rewilded.</p>
