        <strong>CONFUSION: </strong>The shoe is worn by kneeling and lying on the
        ground, allowing the wearer to twist their body like a rattlesnake to make the ball on the
        shoe wiggle and seduce the enemy through the wiggling of the ball. This feature allows the
        wearer to see the shoe as part of their body and control the trajectory of the shoe by
        controlling their body, thus distracting the opponent and allowing the wearer to make their
        next move, such as attacking or hunting.
